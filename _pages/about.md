Hi! Welcome to my website.

Currenlty I am Research Scientist in Amazon Alexa NLU working on NLU models for non-English languages. Previoulsy, I was a Sr Applied AI/ML Assoc. in JPMorganChase & Co. my work has been focussed on applications of AI in Controls and Compliance in trading. 

I had pursued my Ph.D. in Operations Research at University at Buffalo, SUNY. I was advised by [Dr. Rajan Batta](http://engineering.buffalo.edu/home/school/about/people/rajan-batta.html) and [Dr. Qing He](http://engineering.buffalo.edu/civil-structural-environmental/people/faculty_directory/qing-he.html). My doctoral research was focussed on development of methods of [social sensing during disasters](https://nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1663101&HistoricalAwards=false) for better management of essential supplies. I developed [Natural Language Processing methodolgies](https://akrm3008.github.io/publications/paper1/) that extract actionable information from noisy information on social media platforms during crisis. Further, I developed [Decision Models](https://akrm3008.github.io/publications/paper4/) that use this information from social media to determine optimal decisions for people affetcted by disasters, first responders and decision making authorities. As a case study I applied this methodology for managing of gasoline during crisis like Hurricane Irma.

Beyond scientific research and building such application, I have a keen interest in Analytic Philosophy. Recently, I have taken to writing. Some of it is available to read at [my medium page](https://medium.com/@abhinavkhr30) and in my newsletter on [my substack](https://abhinavkhare.substack.com/).
